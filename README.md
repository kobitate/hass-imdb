Home Assistant companion web server to open a media player entityâ€™s content on IMDb using DuckDuckGo's `\` shortcut to visit the first result.

This works by grabbing the current content from a Home Assistant `media_player` entity and searching for the exact episode (or just the movie) on DuckDuckGo. For example: `\The Americans (2013) season 3 episode 3 Open House site:imdb.com`. Including the episode name increased the chances of getting the proper result for some shows. It's slightly imperfect since it relies on the first result being the right one. I also found that DuckDuckGo was friendlier than Google to my clearly automated searching as I was testing. 

Works great in combination with a home screen shortcut on your phone! I used [Hermit for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&hl=en_US&gl=US) to generate a single-site browser for easy, silo'd access so I don't end up with a million IMDb tabs. I also added a local network-wide DNS record to redirect `imdb.example.com` to the server for quick access.

## Setup instructions

1. Clone repository locally.
3. Duplicate `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Update the values (see table below)
4. Run the server by running `node index.js` from the terminal
5. Play a movie or TV show on the device you specified in your environment file, then visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the IP address of your machine)
