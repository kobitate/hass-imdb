# Home Assistant IMDB Shortcut
Home Assistant companion web server to open a media player entityâ€™s content on IMDb using DuckDuckGo's `\` shortcut to visit the first result.

This works by grabbing the current content from a Home Assistant `media_player` entity and searching for the exact episode (or just the movie) on DuckDuckGo. For example: `\The Americans (2013) season 3 episode 3 Open House site:imdb.com`. Including the episode name increased the chances of getting the proper result for some shows. It's slightly imperfect since it relies on the first result being the right one.

Works great in combination with a home screen shortcut on your phone! I used [Hermit for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&hl=en_US&gl=US) to generate a single-site browser for easy, silo'd access so I don't end up with a million IMDb tabs.

## Setup instructions

1. Clone repository locally.
3. Duplicate `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Update the values (see table below)
4. Run the server by running `node index.js` from the terminal
5. Play a movie or TV show on the device you specified in your environment file, then visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the IP address of your machine)
